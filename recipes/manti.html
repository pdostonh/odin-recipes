<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Turkic dish containing dough with different fillings like other dumpings.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting   
    <li>
        ½ teaspoon salt   
    <li>
        2 large eggs
    <li>
        ½ teaspoon water, or as needed
    </li>
    <h2>Fillings:</h2>
    <li>
        2 onions, peeled
    <li>
        ½ pound ground beef
    <li>
        salt and pepper to taste
    </li>
    <h2>Red repped oil:</h2>
    <li>
        3 tablespoons vegetable oil
    <li>
        1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
    </li>
    <h2>Yogurt Sauce:</h2>
    <li>
        1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt
    <li>
        1 tablespoon minced garlic
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Process:</h2>
<ol>
        <li>
            Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
        <li>
            Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.
        <li>
            Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.
        <li>
            Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.
        <li>
            Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.
        <li>
            Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.
        <li>
            Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.
        <li>
            Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.
</ol>
